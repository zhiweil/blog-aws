## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
A network interface's attributes follow it as it is attached or detached from an instance
and reattached to another instance. When you move a network interface from one instance to another,
network traffic is redirected to the new instance.

All EC2 instances of VPC have a primary ENI (eth0), which can be detached.

Besides IP addresses and MAC address, an ENI can be assigned with the following stuff:
* one or more security groups
* a source/destination check flag

## Routing Table
A subnet must be associated with one routing table; a routing table can be associated with multiple subnets.
* VPC comes with a default router and a main modifiable routing table. You cannot delete main routing table.
* You can specify a custom routing table as main routing table.
* A new subnet is associated with main routing table implicitly; until it is associated with a custom subnet explicitly.

### Routing priority
**Longest prefix (most specific) match**

## Internet Gateway
To enable Internet access:
* attach IG to VPC
* add route to routing table pointing to IG
* assign public IP to EC2 instances
* configure network ACL and security group to enable internet flow

## Egress-Only Internet Gateway
* Allows IPv6 outbound communication from VPC to Internet. Egress-only IG is for IPv6 only.
* Egress-only IG is stateful, which means that when you enable outbound flow the corresponding inbound flow
is enabled automatically
* Egress-only IG does not support IPv4

## NAT
**NAT cannot be used with IPv6.**

### NAT Gateway
* NAT gateway is a managed service
* when creating a NAT gateway, you must
    * specify a public subent
    * specify a EIP
    * to achieve better availability in multiple AZs, you'll create multiple NAT gateways in each AZ, and configure resources to use the NAT gateway in the same AZ.
* NAT gateway supports 5 Gbps, can scale upto 45 Gbps automatically. If you require more, you'll need to split your VPC into more subnets and create more NAT gateways.
* EIP cannot be de-associated with NAT gateway after it is created. To use a different EIP, you'll need to create a new NAT gateway.
* NAT gateway supports TCP, UDP and ICMP.
* NAT gateway cannot be accessed by ClassicLink connection.
* NAT gateway can create upto 55000 concurrent connections to the single destination (per minutes); 900 concurrent connection per second to a single connection.
* the "ErrorPortAllocation" error can be monitored in CloudWatch, which indicates that the number of connections might be too many.(
1-minute frequence and upto 15 months persistence)

A NAT gateway **CANNOT** send traffic over
* VPC endpoint
* AWS site-to-site VPN connection
* AWS direct connect
* VPC peering connection

Best practice for sending traffic to S3 and DynamoDB
**Create a NAt gateway endpoint, route traffic via endpoint (no extra charge) instead of NAt gateway**
 
#### Monitoring by Cloudwatch Metrics
* ActiveConnectionCount
* BytesInFromDestination (from outside VPC)
* BytesInFromSource (from inside VPC)
* BytesOutToDestination
* BytesOutToSource
* ConnectionAttemptsCount
* ConnectionEstablishedCount
* ErrorPortAllocation(**important metric indicating that NAT gateway is too busy**)
* IdleTimeoutCount (**connections not closed gracefully will be transitioned from active to idle**)
* PacketsDropCount (**indicating an ongoing transient issue**)
* PacketsInFromDestination
* PacketsInFromSource
* PacketsOutToDestination
* PacketsOutToSource

There is one supported dimension:
* NatGatewayId

### NAT Instance
**NAT instance is for IPv4 only.** Amazon provides EC2 AMI that supports NAT. There is string **amzn-ami-vpc-nat** 
in their names.
* IPv4 forwarding is enabled and ICMP redirects are disabled in /etc/sysctl.d/10-nat-
settings.conf
* A script located at /usr/sbin/configure-pat.sh runs at startup and configures iptables IP
masquerading.
* the source/destination check option **MUSt** be disabled! If NAT instance has more ENIs, should 
do this for all of them.
* NAT instance is simply an EC2 instance, which limitation is up to instance type chosen.

### NAT Gateway and NAT instance

Attributes|NAT Gateway|NAT Instance| 
----------|-----------|------------| 
Availability|AWS managed. Very high.|Managed by User. Need a script to fail over.| 
Bandwidth|upto 45 Gbps|depending on EC2 instance type| 
Maintenance | Amazon | You |
Performance | Amazon | You |
Cost | changed per NAT gateway, data flow and etc.| by EC2 |
Type & Size | you have no choice | you choose by EC2 |
Public IP | EIP assigned at creation | EIP or public IP |
Private IP | assigned when created in subnet | assigned when created in subnet |
Security Group| No | Yes |
Network ACL | control at subnet level | control at subnet level |
Port Forwarding| not supported | can be configured |
Bastion Server | not supported | can be configured as bastion server |
Timeout behaviour | RST packet is sent to source | FIN packet is sent to source|
IP Fragmentation| support UDP, not TCP and ICMP | support TCP, UDP and ICMP|


## DHCP Options Sets
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) provides a standard for passing configuration to hosts on a TCP/IP 
network. 

DHCP Option Name| Description|
-----------------|-------------|
domain-name-servers | upto 4 domain name server IP addresses, or AmazonProvidedDNS(default). |
domain-name | 1. AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, then ec2.internal; <br>2. AmazonProvidedDNS in other region, <region>.compute.internal;<br>3. not using AmazonProvidedDNS, specify a domain name like example.com | 
ntp-servers | upto 4 IP addresses for Network Time Protocol (NTP) |
netbios-name-servers | upto 4 NetBIOS name servers |
netbios-node-type | NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, 8). Type 2 (point-to-point or P-node is recommended). Broadcast and multicase are not supported yet |

### Amazon DNS server
* AmazonProvidedDNS runs on **VPC_base_address + 2**. If there exist more than one CIDR blocks, DNS runs in the primary block.
* Amazon DNS server is used to resolve names defined in a private hosted zone in Route53.
* services use Hadoop framework (like EMR) resolve their FQDN differently, if domain-name-servers is set to a custom value, these
service might fail. 
* Amazon's DNS server is running at 169.254.169.253. 

### Changing DHCP options
* after DHCP options are created and assigned to VPC, it cannot be changed, you'll have create a new one.
* you can configure VPC to use no DHCP options. 
* can only associate one set of DHCP options with a VPC at a time. Delete VPC also delete associated DHCP options set.

## Using DNS with VPC
**DNS does not work with IPv6 addresses**, 
* there are two options on VPC:
    * enableDnsHostnames - whether EC2 instances receive public DNS names, this works only when **enableDnsSupport** is also set to true.
    * enableDnsSupport - DNS can be translated via 169.254.169.253 or **VPC base address + 2**.
* Each Amazon EC2 instance limits the number of packets that can be sent to the Amazon-provided DNS
  server to a **maximum of 1024 packets per second per network interface**. This limit cannot be increased.
* If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, the
  enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes must be set to true.

## VPC Peering
You can set VPC peering between:
* you own VPCs
* VPC in another AWS account
* VPC in a different region

No special hardware is needed to setup VPC peering. No Single point of failure and no bandwidth bottleneck. 

** Elastic IP
