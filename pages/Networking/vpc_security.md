## Comparison of security group and network ACL

Security Group | Network ACL| 
---------------|------------| 
applis to EC2 instance | applies to subnet | 
supports allow rules only | supports both allow and deny rules | 
stateful, return traffic is automatically allowed | stateless, have to configure inbound and outbound separately | 
all rules are evaluated before decision | process rules in number order | 
have to configure EC2 instance explicitly | apply automatically to all EC2 of a subnet | 

## Security group
**Can assign up to 5 security groups to an EC2.** If no security group is specified when launching an EC2, the default security group of VPC applies.

### Basics
* allow rules only
* can specify inbound and outbound rules separately
* by default, a SG has no inbound rule, so no one can access it
* by default, a SG has a outbound rule for everything
* SG rules are stateful
* instances associated with the same SG cannot talk to each other until it is allowed by adding a rule
* SG is associated with ENI. 

### Default security group
* you cannot delete default SG of VPC
* default SG allows inbound traffic from all EC2 instances of the same SG.
* default SG allows all outbound traffic (IPv4 & v6)

### Some Useful Port 
* 80 - http
* 443 - https
* 22 - ssh
* 3389 - RDP
* 1433 - MS SQL Server
* 3306 My SQL
* 5432 PostgreSQL

## Network ACL
### Basics
* VPC has a default ACL (modifiable), which allows all inbound and outbound traffic (IP v4 & v6)
* by default, a new ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
* a new subnet must be associated with a ACL, default ACL will be applied if not specified
* a ACL can be associated with multiple subnets, but a subnet can be associated with only one ACL
* the rules of ACL is evaluated in order
* ACL can have separate inbound and outbound rules, each rule can allow or deny traffic
* ACL rules are stateless
* There is a default rule, with the "*" as the rule number, cannot be removed.


### Ephemeral Port
Ephemeral ports vary depending on the type of OS:
* **Linux** - 32768 - 65535
* **ELB** - 1024 - 65535
* **Windows to server 2003** - 1025 - 5000
* **Windows 2008 and later versions** - 49152-65535
* **NAT gateway** - 1024-65535

### Flog log
Monitor inbound and outbound flows and publish to Cloudwatch or S3. 

If you launch more instances into your subnet after you've created a flow log for your subnet or VPC,
then a new log stream (for CloudWatch Logs) or log file object (for Amazon S3) is created for each new
network interface as soon as any network traffic is recorded for that network interface.

#### Limitations
* Cannot enable flow log for EC2-Classic
* Cannot enable flow log for a peering VPC if the VPC is not under your account
* Cannot tag a flog log
* Cannot change configuration of flow log after it is created
* If an ENI has multiple addresses, flog log shows the primary address always.
